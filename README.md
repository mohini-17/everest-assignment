Technical coverage:

1)Use any technology like React, Vuejs, SCSS, or simple HTML and CSS, etc but provide the assignment including compiled build.
2)Maintain a README.md file with proper instructions for us to review & check the code.
3)UI look & feel should be as per the designs
4)It should support all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
