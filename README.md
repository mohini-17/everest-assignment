Technical coverage:

Use any technology like React, Vuejs, SCSS, or simple HTML and CSS, etc but provide the assignment including compiled build.
Maintain a README.md file with proper instructions for us to review & check the code.
UI look & feel should be as per the designs
It should support all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
It should be responsive (min:320px to max:1440px).




Notes-

1) Created the layout as same as shown in picture
2) Second work 2 image is not proper in image format, if i am customizing the width, it breaks responsive, whereas by using this the text can't be align due to some extra white space in Image.
3) Due to time short i used inline css to fix wherever it was required.
4) Beacuse of Second work 2 imgage resolution is breaking on mobile view.

** I apologize for rest couple of things i didn't cover because of some other online test and intervies but major i completed in 3 hours.It can be more inhance as we have intsruction in Figma like fontSize, font-family, width and heigth **

Thanks for your trust on me :)
